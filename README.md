# Landing Page Project
This is the first project for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree program. with HTML and CSS file code which it done by Udacity. and Javascript file code done by me.


The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
